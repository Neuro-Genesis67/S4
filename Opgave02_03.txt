Implement a static method on your Person class

public static List<Person> ReadCSVFile(string filename)

that reads a file containing lines of persons in the format "Saul;60;63" shown above.
This method returns a list of Person objects from a CSV file.
(I gave you a file called data.csv, you should use)

Reading files one line at a time will help you
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/file-system/how-to-read-a-text-file-one-line-at-a-time

Now you must be able to write code that looks like this:

string filename = @"C:\somewhere\else\or\whereever\data.csv";
var people = Person.ReadCSVFile(filename);
Console.WriteLine("Number of people in data file : " + people.Count);
