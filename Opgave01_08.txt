Exceptions
Create a new Class. Implement the method:
private void MyMethodWithError(int num = 0)

MyMethodWithError must throw an exception.
Call MyMethodWithError from the new method:
public void MyNormalMethod(int num = 0)

MyNormalMethod must catch the exception from MyMethodWithError 
and contain a “finally” statement.

Make sure you write a lot to stdout (This is the normal output to the console), 
so you see what is going on.
