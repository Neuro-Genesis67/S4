There are different ways to sort lists. One of them is to implement the interface IComparer<T> or the IComparer Interface

or
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.icomparer.compare?view=netframework-4.7.2

Implement three classes
public class SortByAge : IComparer<Person>
public class SortByWeight : IComparer<Person>
public class SortByName : IComparer<Person>
so you can sort your list of Persons by Age, Weight, and Name.

Now you must be able to write
people.Sort(new SortByWeight());
and people are sorted by weight.
