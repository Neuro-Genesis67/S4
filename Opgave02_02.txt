Give your Person object a constructor that takes a string in this format as input:
string s = "Saul;60;63";
This means that you can create new Person objects by writing

string s = "Saul;60;63";
var person = new Person(s);
Console.WriteLine(person);
Console.ReadKey();

And get output to console that looks like this:

Saul       :   60 years,   63 kg

To implement this you can use data.Split(';') If data is a string. If you want to know more, the Split  method is described here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string.split?view=netframework-4.7.2
(We will get to regular expressions later)
